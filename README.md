# procedural-city

Code for generating a procedural city, for video games or some kind of simulation. The floor plan generator is mostly based off of the paper **A constrained growth method for procedural floor plan generation** (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265988238_A_constrained_growth_method_for_procedural_floor_plan_generation), with some modifications.
